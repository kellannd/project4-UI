# What is this project?
This project is to centralize transportation requests by shelters and rescues to transport dogs and cats. It allows a rescue or shelter to post a transportation request, where people can accept the request to transport the animal.

# Design Work
## Interview
I interviewed both people who run rescues and people who participate in the transportation process for this project.

## Sketching
Sketches can be found [here]

# Implimentation
Svelte was used to create the base for this app and was hosted on Netlify.

## Styling
All icons used were taken from [Bootstrap Icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/).

Styling for text input boxes, popups, and overlays inspired by [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp).

# Interface

# Future Work
Some features that I would impliment in the future would be to expand the app to allow people who do not have the means or ability to catch strays they see.

Another feature that I would impliment would be to expand it to transport other animals. In my research, I saw a lot of rescues that were also looking to transport farm animals to rescues. For now, the app only supports companian animals, but I would like to expand it to support other domestic animals as well.
